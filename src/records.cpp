// 7.5.3 A 2-delta is stored as an unsigned-integer and represents a horizontal or vertical displacement. Bits 0-1 encode
// direction: 0 for east, 1 for north, 2 for west, and 3 for south. The remaining bits are the magnitude.

// 7.5.4 A 3-delta is stored as an unsigned-integer and represents a horizontal, vertical, or 45-degree diagonal displace-
// ment. Bits 0-2 encode direction: 0 for east, 1 for north, 2 for west, 3 for south, 4 for northeast, 5 for northwest, 6 for
// southwest, and 7 for southeast. The remaining bits are the magnitude (for horizontal and vertical deltas) or the magni-
// tude of the projection onto the x- or y-axis (for 45-degree deltas).

// 7.5.5 A g-delta has two alternative forms and is stored either as a single unsigned-integer or as a pair of unsigned-
// integers. The first form is indicated when bit 0 is zero, and represents a horizontal, vertical, or 45-degree diagonal dis-
// placement, with bits 1-3 encoding direction, and the remaining bits storing the magnitude, in the same fashion as a 3-
// delta. The second form represents a general (x,y) displacement and is a pair of unsigned-integers. Bit 0 of the first
// integer is 1. Bit 1 of the first integer is the x-direction (0 for east, 1 for west). The remaining bits of the first integer
// represent the magnitude in the x-direction. Bit 0 of the second integer is the y-direction (0 for north, 1 for south). The
// remaining bits of the second integer represent the magnitude in the y-direction. Both forms may appear in a list of g-
// deltas.
